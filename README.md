## Features

- **Single-Click Cleanup:** Removes asterisks from greetings, alternate greetings, and dialogue examples
- **Smart Detection:** Preserves legitimate character actions while removing excessive asterisk formatting
- **Automatic Saving:** Changes are saved instantly to your character card

## Usage

1. **Install:** Open SillyTavern → Extensions → Install extension → `https://github.com/DankyDark/asterisks-begone`
2. **Find the Button:** Open any character and locate the "Asterisks Begone" button next to "First Message"
3. **Click to Clean:** Press the button to remove unwanted asterisks

> **Tip:** Back up your character card before use!

## Settings

- **Enabled:** Toggles the extension on/off
- **Check for character actions:** When enabled, preserves legitimate character actions:
  - Detects mixed formatting (regular text with action descriptions)
  - Cleans up when most paragraphs are wrapped in asterisks
  - Disable to remove all asterisks regardless of content
- **Clean description field:** Cleans unwanted asterisks from the description field of the character card as well

## Why Remove Asterisks?

> This extension tackles character cards where entire paragraphs are wrapped in asterisks with only dialogue untouched. It's not for removing all character actions, but for cleaning up cases where excessive asterisk usage diminishes their impact.
